      <p>
        This project maps where countries show up in Reddit discussions and what that distribution says
        about bias in global data. Using more than 400 million Reddit submissions from January to October 2025,
        it extracts country mentions from text and compares absolute visibility with a normalized measure of
        relative attention.

      <p>
        Understanding biases in global data is a central challenge in spatial data science. Data collected
        at a worldwide scale rarely represents all regions equally, but instead reflects structural
        differences in population, infrastructure, language, and access to digital technologies. As a
        result, apparent global patterns often reveal more about how data is generated than about the
        underlying phenomena themselves. Identifying and critically assessing such biases is therefore
        a key objective of this project.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        Social media data offers a particularly illustrative example of these global inequalities. While
        platforms are often perceived as worldwide communication spaces, their usage is highly uneven
        across regions and social groups. In this project, Reddit is used as a case study to examine how
        these biases manifest spatially. As a discussion based platform with a large international user
        base and openly accessible data, Reddit allows for large scale analysis of global discourse, while
        at the same time exhibiting strong regional, linguistic, and socioeconomic imbalances.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        Geographic information on Reddit is not explicitly provided through geotags, but must be inferred
        from unstructured text such as post titles, post bodies, and subreddit names. Although previous
        research has demonstrated that locations can be extracted from Reddit text, the resulting spatial
        patterns are shaped by multiple sources of bias, including language dominance, uneven internet
        access, and platform specific user demographics
        (<a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1810.03067" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harrigian, 2018</a>;
         <a href="https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3683/paper2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stillman &amp; Kruspe, 2024</a>).

      <p>
        The main motivation of this project is to use Reddit data to explore how global biases become
        visible when geographic references are extracted from social media text. Specifically, the study
        analyzes the global spatial distribution of country mentions in Reddit posts and examines how
        these patterns vary across regions.
        Rather than treating country mention patterns as objective representations of global attention,
        the analysis explicitly investigates how these patterns relate to population size, internet
        usage, and levels of socioeconomic development. By comparing absolute country mention counts
        with normalized measures, the project highlights systematic over and under representation of
        different regions.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        Overall, this project aims to visualize global patterns of geographic attention on Reddit while
        critically reflecting on the biases and limitations inherent in social media based spatial
        analysis.

      <div class="section-title">Related Work and Research Gaps</div>
    
      <div class="sub-title">Related Work</div>
    
      <p>
        Geographic information extraction from social media has been an active research topic for more
        than a decade. Most existing studies focus on platforms such as Twitter, now X, while Reddit has
        received comparatively less attention. Early work showed that geographic signals can be derived
        from textual content even when explicit geotags are missing. For example,
        <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1871437.1871535" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
          Cheng, Caverlee, and Lee (2010)
        </a>
        demonstrated that users’ locations can be inferred from tweet content alone. At the same time,
        their results already pointed to strong spatial concentration and uneven representation across
        regions.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        For Reddit in particular,
        <a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1810.03067" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
          Harrigian (2018)
        </a>
        conducted one of the first large scale studies on text based geolocation without relying on
        geotags. The study showed that Reddit posts and user activity contain sufficient geographic cues
        to infer locations at different spatial scales. However, it also revealed substantial biases,
        including a clear dominance of English speaking countries and urban areas, as well as uncertainty
        caused by ambiguous place names and informal language.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        More recent work by
        <a href="https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3683/paper2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
          Stillman and Kruspe (2024)
        </a>
        further explored geolocation extraction from Reddit using machine learning based approaches and
        location focused subreddits. Their findings confirmed that Reddit text contains rich geographic
        information, but also highlighted persistent challenges related to data sparsity, noise, and
        limited coverage outside highly active regions.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        Beyond individual platforms, several studies have explicitly addressed bias in social media based
        spatial analysis more broadly.
        <a href="https://doi.org/10.3390/ijgi10060373" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
          Karami et al. (2021)
        </a>
        showed that only a very small and non representative fraction of Twitter content is geotagged,
        which can lead to systematic spatial distortions when geotagged data is treated as ground truth.
        <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10049246" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
          Zhu et al. (2022)
        </a>
        proposed a broader framework for geoinformation harvesting from social media, emphasizing that
        platform bias, spatial bias, content bias, and methodological bias are inherent properties of
        social media data rather than issues that can be fully removed. 
      </p>
    
      <p>
        Taken together, the existing literature shows that geographic information can be extracted from
        social media text and that platforms such as Reddit offer valuable opportunities for spatial
        analysis. At the same time, prior studies consistently point to limitations related to data
        sources, scale, language, and representativeness. These recurring issues highlight several
        unresolved gaps in current research, particularly with regard to global coverage and bias aware
        interpretation of spatial patterns.
      </p>
      
      <div class="sub-title">Research Gaps</div>
      <p>
        A first gap concerns the platforms and data sources used in existing geolocation studies. Much of the
        previous research focuses on Twitter and relies heavily on geotagged data. Since only a small and non
        representative fraction of social media content is explicitly geotagged, these approaches are based on
        datasets that already contain strong spatial and demographic biases.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        A second gap relates to the scale and scope of Reddit based geolocation research. While Reddit has
        been explored as a data source, most studies focus on small scale analyses, such as city level
        classification, or on specific case studies like natural disasters or man made events. Large scale,
        global mapping of Reddit country mentions remains largely unexplored, and only few studies address the
        challenge of processing hundreds of millions of posts in a scalable and systematic way.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        A third gap concerns the interpretation and comparability of spatial patterns derived from social media
        data. Many studies rely on raw mention counts without sufficient contextualization. Participation in
        online discourse is strongly shaped by population size, internet access, and socioeconomic conditions,
        yet these factors are rarely integrated into the analysis. In addition, many geolocation approaches
        focus predominantly on English place names, reinforcing linguistic and regional biases and limiting
        the global comparability of results.
      </p>

      <hr class="divider">
    
      <p>
        This project addresses these gaps by using Reddit as a large scale case study to examine how global
        spatial patterns emerge from social media data. By combining scalable text processing, multilingual
        location extraction, and normalization using socioeconomic indicators, the study treats bias as a
        central analytical dimension rather than a secondary limitation.

    <!-- Research Questions -->
    <div class="card" id="research-questions">
      <div class="section-title">Research Questions</div>
      <p>
        Building on the identified research gaps, this project addresses the following research questions:
      </p>
      <div class="note big">
        <strong>RQ1.</strong> How are country mentions in Reddit posts spatially distributed across the globe?<br><br>
        <strong>RQ2.</strong> Which spatial biases become visible when global Reddit country mentions are mapped?<br><br>
        <strong>RQ3.</strong> Which countries receive disproportionately high or low attention relative to population size and internet usage?<br><br>
        <strong>RQ4.</strong> How does relative Reddit activity relate to national development levels (HDI)?
      </div>
      <p>
        Together, these questions aim to explore not only the global distribution of Reddit country mentions,
        but also the structural biases underlying these patterns and their relationship to demographic and
        socioeconomic factors.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Data -->
    <div class="card" id="data">
      <div class="section-title">Data</div>
    
      <div class="sub-title">Reddit Data</div>
      <p>
        The primary dataset used in this project consists of Reddit submission data obtained from
        <a href="https://academictorrents.com/browse.php?search=reddit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
          Academic Torrents
        </a>,
        a platform that provides large scale Reddit data dumps for research purposes. The data is
        publicly available and allows unrestricted access to historical Reddit submissions.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        In total, the dataset includes more than <strong>400 million Reddit posts</strong>, with a compressed file size of
        approximately <strong>166.5&nbsp;GB</strong>. The data covers a ten month period from <strong>January to October 2025</strong> and
        is provided as monthly files in compressed JSON Lines format. Each monthly file contains all
        Reddit submissions published within the respective month.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        For this project, only the textual components of Reddit submissions were considered. Specifically,
        post titles, post bodies, and subreddit names were extracted for analysis. User comments were
        deliberately excluded in order to reduce the overall data volume and to focus on the main content
        of submissions, which typically contains the most relevant geographic references.
      </p>
    
      <div class="sub-title">Additional Data Sources</div>
      <p>
        To support the analysis of spatial bias and to enable meaningful comparisons between countries,
        the Reddit based country mention data was combined with several external country level datasets.
      </p>
    
      <ul style="margin: 10px 0 10px 18px; padding-left: 0;">
        <li style="margin-bottom: 10px; line-height: 1.65;">

      </ul>
    
      <div class="sub-title">Scope of the Dataset</div>
      <p>
        The dataset represents patterns of geographic attention in Reddit discourse rather than the
        physical locations of users or events. Country mentions reflect which countries are discussed on
        Reddit and how frequently they appear in submissions, not where users are located or where events
        necessarily take place.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        By combining large scale Reddit data with external country level indicators, the dataset provides
        a suitable basis for examining global spatial biases in social media data.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Methods -->
    <div class="card" id="methods">
      <div class="section-title">Methods</div>
    
      <div class="sub-title">Data Preparation and Workflow</div>
      <p>
        As a first step, the monthly Reddit submission files were downloaded via a BitTorrent client and
        processed in a JupyterLab environment. Each monthly file was handled separately in order to manage
        memory usage and to ensure a consistent processing workflow across the entire study period.
      </p>
      <p>
        For each Reddit submission, the textual content relevant for geographic analysis was extracted. This
        includes post titles, post bodies, and subreddit names. These text components form the basis for
        identifying country references in Reddit discourse.
      </p>
    
      <div class="sub-title">Multilingual Country Dictionary</div>
      <p>
        To reduce the strong bias toward English language content commonly observed in social media
        analyses, a multilingual country dictionary was created. The dictionary contains official country
        names in thirty major world languages and was constructed using information retrieved from
        Wikidata. Together, these languages cover more than ninety percent of the global speaking population.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to official country names, a separate list of widely used short country synonyms and
        abbreviations was compiled. Examples include “US” for the United States and “UK” for the United
        Kingdom. This step improves recall by capturing informal references frequently used in Reddit posts.
      </p>
    
      <div class="sub-title">Country Matching and Scalability</div>
      <p>
        The central methodological challenge of this project was the extraction of country mentions from
        several hundred million Reddit posts. Multiple text matching approaches were tested during
        development. However, most conventional methods proved to be too slow and computationally
        inefficient for datasets of this size, with estimated runtimes of several days.
      </p>
      <p>
        To address this limitation, the <strong>Aho–Corasick string matching algorithm</strong> was used. This algorithm
        allows thousands of country names to be matched simultaneously in a single pass through the text. As
        a result, country extraction could be performed efficiently and at scale, making the analysis of very
        large Reddit datasets feasible.

        Short country synonyms such as “US” or “UK” are highly ambiguous and can easily lead to false
        positive matches. To reduce this problem, additional context-based rules were applied alongside the
        string matching process.
      </p>
      <p>
        Country matches were only accepted when they appeared in a clear geographic context, for example
        when preceded or followed by terms such as “in”, “from”, or “to”. This filtering step helps ensure that
        short abbreviations are interpreted as country references rather than unrelated words or expressions.
      </p>
    
      <div class="sub-title">Reddit Activity Index</div>
      <p>
        To move beyond raw country mention counts, a custom Reddit Activity Index (RAI) was developed.
        The RAI measures how frequently a country is mentioned on Reddit relative to the number of active
        internet users in that country.
      </p>
      <p>
        The index is calculated by dividing the total number of Reddit country mentions by the estimated
        number of internet users, derived from population size and internet usage rates. A logarithmic
        transformation is applied to improve comparability between countries of very different sizes and
        levels of online participation.
      </p>
      <p>
        This index enables a more balanced comparison of Reddit attention across countries and helps
        highlight relative over and under representation.
      </p>

      <div class="sub-title">Map Creation and Visualization</div>
      <p>
        In the final step, all matched Reddit posts were aggregated at the country level. The aggregated
        country data was then linked with population size, internet usage rates, Human Development Index
        values, and the Reddit Activity Index.
      </p>
      <p>
        The final visualization was created using the Folium library. The map includes multiple layers,
        legends, interactive popups, and an information panel to support interpretation. This interactive design
        allows users to explore global patterns of Reddit country mentions and associated indicators in a
        transparent and intuitive way.

    <!-- Interactive Map -->
    <div class="card" id="interactive-map">
      <div class="section-title">Interactive Map</div>
    
      <p>
        The interactive map represents the global spatial distribution of country mentions in Reddit posts
        and combines multiple dimensions of Reddit activity in a single visualization. <strong>Country polygons</strong> are
        colored according to their Human Development Index (HDI), <strong>bubble size</strong> represents the total number
        of Reddit posts mentioning a country, and <strong>bubble color</strong> encodes the Reddit Activity Index (RAI),
        indicating relative attention adjusted for the size of the online population.
      </p>

      <hr class="divider">
    
      <p>
        Several spatial patterns are immediately visible. Reddit attention is strongly concentrated in
        <strong>North America and Western Europe</strong>, with particularly large bubbles for the United States, Canada,
        and the United Kingdom. In contrast, large parts of Africa, Central Asia, and Southeast Asia show
        comparatively small bubbles, indicating lower absolute visibility in Reddit discussions.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        The map also highlights the difference between <strong>absolute and relative attention</strong>. While large
        countries dominate total mention counts, several smaller countries become more prominent when
        attention is normalized using the Reddit Activity Index. This is especially visible in Northern
        and Western Europe, where relatively small populations coincide with high relative Reddit activity.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        In addition, the visualization reveals a clear <strong>West–East and North–South gradient</strong>. Countries with
        higher HDI levels tend to display darker bubble colors, indicating higher relative Reddit activity,
        whereas countries with lower development levels generally show lower relative attention. At the
        same time, notable exceptions are visible, underlining that development level alone does not fully
        explain Reddit participation.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        Overall, the map provides a spatial overview that makes global inequalities and biases in Reddit
        attention directly visible and serves as a visual foundation for the quantitative analyses
        presented in the following sections.

      <div class="section-title">Analysis</div>
    
      <div class="sub-title">Overall Distribution and Concentration of Country Mentions</div>
      <p>
        Across the analyzed Reddit submissions, a total of <strong>186 different countries</strong> were mentioned.
        From more than <strong>408 million Reddit posts</strong>, approximately <strong>9.3 million posts</strong>, or about 2.3 percent
        of all submissions, contained at least one country reference. These matched posts originate from
        roughly <strong>1.1 million unique subreddits</strong>, indicating that geographic references appear across a wide
        range of topics and communities.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        The distribution of country mentions is highly uneven. The United States clearly dominates the
        dataset with more than 3.3 million mentions, followed by Canada with approximately 800,000
        mentions and the United Kingdom with around 720,000. In contrast, the <strong>median number of mentions
        per country is only about 7,000</strong>, and many countries receive fewer than 1,000 mentions in total.
      </p>

      </div>
    
      <p>
        This imbalance becomes even clearer when considering cumulative shares. <strong>The top five countries
        account for more than 60 percent of all country mentions</strong>, while the top ten represent over
        70 percent. Expanding the view further, the top twenty countries already account for more than
        85 percent of all mentions. Overall, these results show that global Reddit attention is strongly
        concentrated on a small number of countries, while large parts of the world receive comparatively
        little visibility.
      </p>

      <hr class="divider">
    
      <div class="sub-title">Reddit Activity Index (RAI)</div>
      <p>
        When country mentions are normalized using the Reddit Activity Index, the observed patterns
        change substantially compared to raw mention counts. The RAI measures country mentions relative
        to the estimated number of active internet users and therefore highlights relative attention
        rather than absolute volume.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        Countries with the highest RAI values are predominantly small and highly concentrated countries,
        such as Greenland, Monaco, Iceland, Malta, and Liechtenstein. In contrast, countries with large
        populations or lower development levels tend to show much lower relative attention, even if they
        appear frequently in absolute terms. This demonstrates that countries dominating raw mention
        counts do not necessarily receive the highest relative attention once differences in online
        population size are taken into account.

      <div class="sub-title">Relationship Between Reddit Activity and Human Development</div>
      <p>
        An analysis of the relationship between the Reddit Activity Index and the Human Development
        Index reveals a moderate positive correlation. <strong>Pearson’s correlation coefficient yields a value
        of r = 0.544</strong>, while <strong>Spearman’s rank correlation results in a slightly higher value of ρ = 0.594</strong>.
        Both measures indicate that countries with higher HDI values tend to show higher relative Reddit
        activity.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        In addition, the median Reddit Activity Index increases systematically across HDI categories,
        suggesting that countries with higher levels of socioeconomic development are more visible in
        Reddit discourse relative to the size of their online population.
      </p>
    
      <div class="figure-block">
        <img src="./RAI_vs_HDI_outlier.jpg" alt="RAI versus HDI with outlier">
      </div>
    
      <p>
        However, notable outliers are present. <span style="color:#e11d48;">United Arab Emirates</span>, for example, combines a very
        high HDI with the lowest Reddit Activity Index value in the dataset. This pattern suggests
        that factors beyond development level, such as cultural preferences, language use, or the
        popularity of alternative social media platforms, may strongly influence Reddit participation.
      </p>

      <hr class="divider">
    
      <div class="sub-title">Spatial Patterns and Notable Cases</div>
      <p>
        The spatial visualization of Reddit country mentions highlights strong regional imbalances.
        Western and English speaking countries dominate the map, even when multilingual country names
        are included in the extraction process. This reflects the predominantly Western user base of
        Reddit and reinforces existing linguistic and platform related biases.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        In some cases, high country visibility appears to be driven by specific events or thematic
        attention rather than sustained participation. Ukraine, for instance, ranks among the top
        countries by total mentions, which can be linked to ongoing global discussions related to the
        war. Greenland, which ranks highest in the Reddit Activity Index, shows elevated relative
        attention that may be associated with increased media coverage and political statements in early
        2025.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        Overall, the results show that Reddit attention is highly concentrated, unevenly distributed,
        and strongly shaped by structural, linguistic, and contextual factors.
      </p>

    <!-- Conclusion -->
    <div class="card" id="conclusion">
      <div class="section-title">Conclusion and Take-Home Message</div>
    
      <p>
        This project examined global patterns of geographic attention on Reddit in order to better
        understand biases in large scale social media data. The results show that global Reddit attention
        is highly uneven and dominated by a small number of primarily Western countries, with the United
        States playing a particularly central role. Large parts of the world receive comparatively little
        visibility, even when multilingual country names are included in the analysis.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        A key finding is the strong contrast between absolute country mention counts and relative
        attention, as measured by the Reddit Activity Index. Countries that dominate raw mention counts
        do not necessarily exhibit high relative attention once differences in population size and
        internet usage are taken into account. This highlights the importance of normalization when
        interpreting global social media patterns.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        The analysis further shows that relative Reddit activity generally increases with a country’s
        level of human development, as reflected by a moderate positive correlation between the Reddit
        Activity Index and the Human Development Index. At the same time, notable outliers demonstrate
        that development level alone cannot explain Reddit participation. Cultural factors, language use,
        and the popularity of alternative platforms appear to play an important role in shaping online
        visibility.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        In addition, the results indicate that small countries can receive disproportionately high
        attention when global discussions are driven by specific events. Examples such as Ukraine or
        Greenland illustrate that short term political or media dynamics can strongly influence spatial
        attention patterns, emphasizing the need to consider contextual factors behind unusually high
        values.
      </p>
    
      <p class="note big">
        <strong>Take-Home Message:</strong>
        Overall, this project demonstrates that global Reddit activity patterns are not neutral
        representations of worldwide attention. Instead, they are shaped by language, platform
        structure, major global events, and broader socioeconomic conditions. As a result, spatial
        patterns derived from social media data must be interpreted critically, with a clear awareness
        of the biases embedded in how such data is generated and distributed.
