        This dashboard visualizes migrant deaths and disappearances across the globe. It highlights major migration
        corridors and uses spatial analysis to uncover meaningful geographic and temporal patterns. The visualizations
        aim to support humanitarian understanding through interactive maps and clustering techniques.

      <div class="section-title">Motivation</div>
      <p>
        Every year, thousands of migrants risk their lives crossing international borders. Many do not survive.
        While these tragedies are often reduced to numbers, this project uses data to identify where and when these
        deaths and disappearances happen, across multiple major migration routes.
      </p>
      <p>
        By uncovering spatial and temporal patterns in migrant fatalities across the top six most dangerous migration
        corridors, including the Mediterranean, the US Mexico border, the Sahara Desert and others, this analysis aims
        to support evidence based action. The goal is not just to visualize loss, but to reveal where preventive
        measures could save the most lives.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Data Source -->
    <div class="card" id="data-source">
      <div class="section-title">Data Source</div>
      <p>
        The data is provided by the International Organization for Migration through the Missing Migrants Project.
        It documents deaths and disappearances during migration worldwide. The dataset includes time, location,
        demographics, and cause of death. It spans from 2014 to the present and is continuously updated by NGOs,
        media, and official sources.

    <!-- Global Heatmap -->
    <div class="card" id="heatmap">
      <div class="section-title">Global Heatmap of Incidents</div>
      <p>
        To provide an initial spatial overview, I created a global heatmap that shows where migrant deaths and
        disappearances have occurred since 2014. Each data point is weighted by the number of dead and missing
        persons to emphasize severity.
      </p>
      <p>
        This visualization helps identify high risk zones and geographic concentrations of migrant fatalities. It
        serves as a baseline for more detailed route specific analyses that follow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clear global patterns emerge from this heatmap: high densities are visible in North Africa, the Central and
        Eastern Mediterranean, the US Mexico border region, and the Afghanistan Iran corridor, highlighting where
        deadly risks are most acute.

    <!-- Exploratory Visualizations -->
    <div class="card" id="exploratory">
      <div class="section-title">Exploratory Visualizations: Demographics, Origins, Causes and Routes</div>
      <p>
        To understand the underlying patterns in migrant deaths, we first explore descriptive statistics and
        visualizations based on the full dataset. These include demographic breakdowns, top countries of origin,
        the most common causes of death, and the relative frequency and danger of different migration routes.
        These insights help lay the foundation for the spatial analyses that follow.
      </p>

      <!-- Demographics -->
      <div class="sub-title">Demographic Profile of the Deceased: Demographic Distribution</div>
      <p>
        The vast majority of recorded deaths involve men (66.3 percent), followed by women (20.9 percent) and
        children (12.9 percent). This distribution reflects broader global migration patterns, where adult males
        are more likely to undertake risky routes. However, the substantial proportion of women and children
        highlights growing vulnerabilities across migrant groups, particularly in family based or forced
        displacements.

      <!-- Origins -->
      <div class="sub-title">Geographic Origins of Migrants: Top 10 Countries of Origin</div>
      <p>
        The country of origin offers important context for understanding migratory push factors. A significant
        portion of the data is marked as “Unknown”, underscoring the frequent lack of identification during fatal
        incidents. Among identifiable cases, countries like Afghanistan (17 percent) and Mexico (8 percent) are
        most represented, followed by a variety of African and Central American nations. These patterns correspond
        to regions affected by conflict, instability, and poverty.

      <!-- Causes -->
      <div class="sub-title">Causes of Death: Top 6</div>
      <p>
        By far the most frequent cause of death is drowning (57.5 percent), highlighting the extreme risks of
        maritime crossings, especially in the Mediterranean and Atlantic. A considerable portion of cases are
        labeled as mixed or unknown causes (14.5 percent), revealing gaps in incident reporting. Other major
        contributors include hazardous transport accidents (8.9 percent), violence (6.8 percent), and harsh
        environmental conditions (6.8 percent) such as dehydration, desert exposure, and extreme temperatures,
        particularly on land routes through the Sahara.

      <!-- Routes: incidents -->
      <div class="sub-title">Migration Routes: Comparing Exposure and Fatality</div>
      <p>
        <strong>Routes by reported incidents.</strong> This bar chart shows the most frequently reported migration
        routes in terms of number of incidents. The US Mexico border leads with approximately 35 percent of all
        reported incidents, followed by the Afghanistan Iran corridor and Sahara Desert crossings. However, 
        this chart only reflects <strong>incident frequency</strong>, not the severity of each incident.
        It is important to note that a single recorded incident may involve <em>one individual</em>
        or <em>many people</em>. For example, an incident can represent a large-scale boat disaster
        resulting in hundreds of deaths, or a single migrant who dies during a desert crossing.
      </p>

      </div>

      <p style="margin-top:16px;">
        <strong>Routes by deaths and missing.</strong> When shifting the focus to the actual number of deaths and
        disappearances, a stark contrast becomes evident: the Mediterranean route emerges as the deadliest by far,
        accounting for over 50 percent of all recorded deaths globally. Other high risk corridors include the Sahara
        Desert (11 percent), US Mexico border (10 percent), Canary Islands route (7.7 percent), Eastern Route to or
        from EHOA (6.8 percent), and the Afghanistan Iran corridor (5 percent).
      </p>

      </div>

      <p>
        The observed differences between migration routes based on incident counts versus total deaths and missing 
        persons are largely explained by the nature of incidents on each route: At the US–Mexico border, 
        many incidents involve individual crossings, where typically one person is recorded as missing or deceased. 
        In contrast, Mediterranean incidents often involve entire boats capsizing, where a single incident can result 
        in dozens or even hundreds of deaths at once, due to overcrowded vessels attempting dangerous sea crossings.
      </p>

      <div class="note big">
        <strong>Analytical focus:</strong><br>
        While incident-based visualizations provide insight into the frequency of reported events,
        they do not capture the <em>severity</em> of migration routes.
        <br><br>
        For this reason, the subsequent analyses focus on migration corridors ranked by the
        number of <strong>deaths and missing persons</strong>, which provide a more meaningful measure
        of humanitarian impact.
        <br><br>
        In detail, it concentrates on six major corridors that together
        account for over <strong>92&nbsp;percent of global recorded deaths</strong>:
        the Mediterranean routes (Central, Western, Eastern), the Sahara Desert,
        the US–Mexico border, the Canary Islands route,
        the Eastern Route to or from EHOA, and the Afghanistan–Iran corridor.
        These corridors were selected due to their high fatality burden, geographic diversity,
        and representativeness of broader global migration patterns.
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Temporal and Spatial-Temporal Patterns -->
    <div class="card" id="temporal">
      <div class="section-title">Temporal and Spatial-Temporal Patterns</div>
    
      <p>
        In this step, we examine how the total number of deaths and missing persons changes over time.
        We first analyze temporal patterns on a monthly and yearly level to identify seasonality and longer-term trends.
        Building on this, we incorporate geography by calculating weighted average incident locations for months and years,
        which helps to assess whether the spatial center of high-fatality incidents shifts over time.
      </p>
    
      <div class="sub-title">Monthly Patterns</div>
      <p>
        When aggregating deaths and missing by month, clear seasonal variations become apparent,
        particularly along maritime routes. The Mediterranean corridor consistently records the
        highest number of fatalities throughout the year, with pronounced peaks during the spring
        and early summer months, especially in April, May, and June. These periods correspond to
        calmer sea conditions, during which a higher number of crossings are attempted, often in
        overcrowded and unsafe vessels.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        Other routes, such as the Sahara Desert, the Canary Islands, and the Eastern Route to or
        from EHOA, exhibit more moderate seasonal fluctuations. In contrast, the US–Mexico border
        shows a relatively even distribution of deaths and missing across the year. This reflects
        fundamental differences in migration mechanisms: while sea-based crossings are highly
        dependent on weather and seasonal conditions, land-based routes are influenced by a broader
        range of social, political, and enforcement-related factors and are less directly tied to
        climate seasonality.
      </p>
    
      <!-- Monthly plot -->
      <div class="figure-block">
        <img src="./DaM_by_Month.jpg" alt="Total deaths and missing by month across migration routes">
      </div>
    
      <div class="sub-title">Yearly Patterns</div>
      <p>
        Examining the data on a yearly basis reveals distinct longer-term trends across the
        selected migration corridors. Deaths along the Mediterranean routes peaked sharply between
        2015 and 2016, followed by a substantial decline until around 2020. In more recent years,
        particularly between 2022 and 2023, fatalities have increased again, indicating a renewed
        intensification of risk along this corridor.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        The Canary Islands route and the Afghanistan–Iran corridor display a different trajectory,
        with marked increases in deaths and disappearances after 2020. These trends suggest shifting
        migration pressures and route adaptations in response to geopolitical developments,
        border controls, and regional instability. In contrast, the Sahara Desert and the
        US–Mexico border routes remain comparatively stable over time, showing fluctuations but
        no dramatic peaks comparable to those observed in the Mediterranean.
      </p>

      </div>

      <div class="sub-title">Maps: Monthly and Yearly Spatial Shifts</div>
      <p>
        To incorporate spatial aspects into the temporal analysis, I calculated weighted average incident
        locations for both months and years. The incident coordinates are weighted by the number of deaths and
        missing persons, so that high-severity events influence the spatial center more strongly than low-impact
        incidents.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        <strong>Monthly spatial shifts.</strong> When looking at the monthly centroids, no clear or systematic
        seasonal shifts can be observed. The centroids remain tightly concentrated within a relatively small
        area in North Africa, primarily around northern Algeria and the surrounding region. This concentration
        is plausible given that this area lies geographically between the eastern corridors (Afghanistan–Iran,
        Eastern Route EHOA) and western corridors (US–Mexico border, Canary Islands) included in the analysis.
        Minor east–west fluctuations exist across months, but they appear irregular rather than seasonally driven.
      </p>
    
      <div class="media">
        <iframe src="./Locations_by_Month.html" loading="lazy"></iframe>
      </div>
    
      <p style="margin-top:16px;">
        <strong>Yearly spatial shifts.</strong> Across years, the centroids show slightly broader movement,
        while still remaining largely confined to the North African corridor. In earlier years (2014 to 2016),
        the centroid positions appear somewhat further east, closer to Libya. In later years (2019 to 2023),
        a modest westward shift toward Algeria and parts of the Western Sahara becomes visible. This pattern may
        reflect changing route dynamics, including a reduced dominance of the Central Mediterranean and an
        increasing relevance of western corridors such as the Canary Islands route. Notably, the centroid in 2025
        shifts markedly eastward again. Since 2025 is not complete, this point should be interpreted cautiously
        and may change as additional incidents are reported.

    <div class="card" id="clustering">
      <div class="section-title">K-Means Clustering (Spatial Segmentation)</div>
    
      <p>
        To investigate spatial structure in the six selected migration corridors, I applied K-Means clustering to all
        incidents. Because the dataset spans globally distributed routes, the goal is to test whether an unsupervised
        method can separate incidents into broad geographic zones that correspond to major migration regions.
      </p>
    
      <div class="sub-title">Cluster Selection using the Elbow Method</div>
      <p>
        I used the Elbow Method to identify a suitable number of clusters. The inertia decreases sharply up to k equals
        3, after which the curve flattens, suggesting diminishing returns when adding more clusters. Based on this
        pattern, I selected k equals 3.
      </p>
    
      <div class="figure-block">

      </div>
    
      <div class="sub-title">Resulting Clusters and Interpretation</div>
      <p>
        The clustering separates into three broad spatial groups. One cluster captures cases around the
        US Mexico border and parts of Central America. A second cluster groups cases across Eastern Africa, the Horn
        of Africa, the Middle East, and the Afghanistan Iran corridor. The third cluster concentrates around North Africa,
        the Sahara, and the broader Mediterranean zone, reflecting the high density of maritime and desert incidents in
        that region.

      <div class="sub-title">Limitations of K-Means in this Context</div>
      <p>
        While K-Means provides a useful first segmentation, it has clear limitations for globally distributed migration
        data. The method assigns every point to a cluster and therefore cannot explicitly treat isolated outliers as
        noise. It also assumes compact, roughly spherical clusters, which is a poor fit for elongated route-like spatial
        patterns. Finally, a global three cluster solution necessarily simplifies regional nuances, especially for smaller
        or more diffuse routes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite these constraints, the results still help to visualise broad spatial separation between major migration
        corridors and provide a clear baseline for more route-specific spatial analysis.

    <!-- DBSCAN -->

      <div class="section-title">DBSCAN Clustering</div>
    
      <p>
        In this step, I applied DBSCAN, a density based clustering method, to identify spatial clusters driven by the
        concentration of incidents across the six selected migration corridors. Unlike K Means, DBSCAN does not require
        specifying the number of clusters in advance and can explicitly label noise points, which is useful for global
        datasets with outliers and uneven spatial density.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        After extensive parameter tuning and multiple iterations, I selected eps equals 0.15 and min samples equals 10.
        This configuration captured the dominant global cluster structure while maintaining a meaningful separation between
        dense corridors and spatial outliers.
      </p>
    
      <div class="sub-title">Results and Interpretation</div>
      <p>
        DBSCAN identifies a clear cluster along the US Mexico border region. A second and largest cluster covers North
        Africa and the Mediterranean, including the Central Mediterranean and Sahara related areas, reflecting the highest
        density of severe cases. A separate cluster captures the Canary Islands corridor, which is geographically
        distinct from Mediterranean crossings. Another cluster isolates cases along the Afghanistan Iran corridor.
        In addition, DBSCAN labels many scattered points as noise, representing spatial outliers across various regions.

      <div class="sub-title">Advantages of DBSCAN in this Context</div>
      <p>
        DBSCAN is well suited here because it preserves the distinction between dense migration corridors and isolated
        incidents. This avoids a key issue of K Means, where all points must be assigned to a cluster even when the
        assignment is not meaningful. The resulting clusters align closely with the known geography of the dominant
        corridors while keeping globally scattered cases separate as noise.

    <!-- KDE Hotspot Analysis -->
    <div class="card" id="kde">
      <div class="section-title">KDE Hotspot Analysis: Incorporating Incidents and Deaths</div>
    
      <p>
        As a next step, <strong>Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)</strong> was applied, where individual
        incidents are weighted by their number of <em>deaths and missing persons</em>. 
        In contrast to <strong>K-Means</strong> and <strong>DBSCAN</strong>, which assign incidents to
        discrete spatial clusters, KDE represents spatial
        patterns as a continuous surface and shows not just where incidents occur, but where the
        <em>most severe ones</em> are concentrated. Therefore, incidents with higher fatality counts have a stronger influence on the resulting
        density surface than single-fatality events. By providing a smooth and continuous representation of spatial risk, the KDE analysis complements
        the discrete clustering approaches.
      </p>
    
      <!-- KDE Map -->
      <div class="media">
        <iframe src="./KDE.html" loading="lazy"></iframe>
      </div>
    
      <p style="margin-top:16px;">
        The resulting density surface reveals a very pronounced global hotspot centered over
        <strong>North Africa</strong>. The highest intensity values are concentrated around
        Libya, Tunisia, and the central Saharan corridor, indicating that this region dominates
        the global distribution of severe migration-related fatalities.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        Despite the worldwide extent of the dataset, nearly all high-weighted density accumulates
        in this zone, reflecting both a high number of incidents and exceptionally high fatality
        counts per incident. This strong spatial concentration closely confirms the patterns
        identified earlier through route-based comparisons and temporal analyses.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        Other regions, including the US–Mexico border, Western Africa along the Canary Islands route,
        and eastern migration corridors, appear far less prominent in the weighted density surface.
        In these areas, either incidents are less frequent or the average number of deaths per incident
        is substantially lower, resulting in a comparatively minor contribution to the global KDE pattern.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        By integrating both <strong>where incidents happen</strong> and <strong>how deadly they are</strong>,
        this step offers a crucial additional perspective on the geography of migrant fatalities and
        further reinforces the central role of the North African corridor as the most critical
        global hotspot.
