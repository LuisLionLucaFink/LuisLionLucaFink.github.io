    <h1>Mapping the Invisible</h1>
    <p>Spatial & Temporal Analysis of Death and Missing Along International Migration Routes.</p>

      <h2>Overview</h2>
    
      <p>
        This dashboard visualizes reported migrant deaths and disappearances worldwide and places them
        in a spatial and temporal context. It highlights major international migration corridors
        and applies GIS based analysis to uncover recurring geographic patterns and temporal trends.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        Using interactive maps and spatial clustering techniques, the visualizations aim to make
        high risk regions and migration related mortality patterns more visible and comparable
        across regions and time periods. The project is intended to support humanitarian awareness
        and data driven interpretation of migration related risks.
      </p>

      <h2>Motivation</h2>
    
      <p>
        Every year, thousands of migrants risk their lives crossing international borders.
        Many do not survive. While these tragedies are often reduced to numbers, this project
        uses data to identify where and when deaths and disappearances occur across major
        migration routes.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        By uncovering spatial and temporal patterns in migrant fatalities across the six most
        dangerous migration corridors, including the Mediterranean, the US Mexico border, the
        Sahara Desert, and others, the analysis aims to support evidence based action. The goal
        is not only to visualize loss, but to highlight where preventive measures could save the
        most lives.

      <h2>Data Source</h2>
    
      <p>
        The data is provided by the International Organization for Migration through the Missing
        Migrants Project. It documents deaths and disappearances during migration worldwide.
        The dataset includes time, location, demographics, and reported cause of death.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        It covers the period from 2014 to the present and is continuously updated based on
        reports from NGOs, media, and official sources.
