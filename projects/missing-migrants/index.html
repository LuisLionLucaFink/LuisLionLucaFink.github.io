    <h1>Mapping the Invisible</h1>
    <p>Spatial & Temporal Analysis of Death and Missing Along International Migration Routes.</p>

  <!-- OVERVIEW -->
  <section class="card">
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      This dashboard visualizes migrant deaths and disappearances across the globe.
      It highlights major migration corridors and applies spatial analysis methods
      to uncover meaningful geographic and temporal patterns.
    </p>
    <p>
      The visualizations aim to support humanitarian understanding through
      interactive maps and clustering techniques.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- MOTIVATION -->
  <section class="card">
    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>
      Every year, thousands of migrants risk their lives crossing international borders.
      Many do not survive. While these tragedies are often reduced to numbers,
      this project uses data to identify where and when these deaths and disappearances occur
      across multiple major migration routes.
    </p>
    <p>
      By uncovering spatial and temporal patterns in migrant fatalities across the
      six most dangerous migration corridors including the Mediterranean,
      the US-Mexico border and the Sahara Desert,
      this analysis aims to support evidence-based action.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal is not only to visualize loss,
      but to reveal where preventive measures could save the most lives.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- DATA SOURCE -->
  <section class="card">
    <h2>Data Source</h2>
    <p>
      The data is provided by the International Organization for Migration through
      the Missing Migrants Project.
      It documents deaths and disappearances during migration worldwide.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dataset includes time, location, demographic information,
      and cause of death, spanning from 2014 to the present.
      Data is continuously updated based on reports from NGOs,
      media sources, and official institutions.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- GLOBAL HEATMAP -->
  <section class="card">
    <h2>Global Heatmap of Incidents</h2>
    <p>
      To provide an initial spatial overview,
      a global heatmap was created showing where migrant deaths
      and disappearances have occurred since 2014.
      Each data point is weighted by the number of dead and missing persons
      to emphasize severity.
    </p>
    <p>
      This visualization highlights high-risk zones and geographic concentrations
      of migrant fatalities and serves as a baseline for
      more detailed route-specific analyses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clear global patterns emerge, with high densities in North Africa,
      the Central and Eastern Mediterranean,
      the US-Mexico border region,
      and the Afghanistan-Iran corridor.
