      <div class="section-title">Overview</div>
      <p>
        This dashboard visualizes migrant deaths and disappearances across the globe. It highlights major migration
        corridors and uses spatial analysis to uncover meaningful geographic and temporal patterns. The visualizations
        aim to support humanitarian understanding through interactive maps and clustering techniques.

    <!-- Motivation -->
    <div class="card">
      <div class="section-title">Motivation</div>
      <p>
        Every year, thousands of migrants risk their lives crossing international borders. Many do not survive.
        While these tragedies are often reduced to numbers, this project uses data to identify where and when these
        deaths and disappearances happen, across multiple major migration routes.
      </p>
      <p>
        By uncovering spatial and temporal patterns in migrant fatalities across the top six most dangerous migration
        corridors, including the Mediterranean, the US Mexico border, the Sahara Desert and others, this analysis aims
        to support evidence based action. The goal is not just to visualize loss, but to reveal where preventive
        measures could save the most lives.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Data Source -->
    <div class="card">
      <div class="section-title">Data Source</div>
      <p>
        The data is provided by the International Organization for Migration through the Missing Migrants Project.
        It documents deaths and disappearances during migration worldwide. The dataset includes time, location,
        demographics, and cause of death. It spans from 2014 to the present and is continuously updated by NGOs,
        media, and official sources.

    <!-- Global Heatmap -->
    <div class="card">
      <div class="section-title">Global Heatmap of Incidents</div>
      <p>
        To provide an initial spatial overview, we created a global heatmap that shows where migrant deaths and
        disappearances have occurred since 2014. Each data point is weighted by the number of dead and missing
        persons to emphasize severity.
      </p>
      <p>
        This visualization helps identify high risk zones and geographic concentrations of migrant fatalities. It
        serves as a baseline for more detailed route specific analyses that follow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clear global patterns emerge from this heatmap: high densities are visible in North Africa, the Central and
        Eastern Mediterranean, the US Mexico border region, and the Afghanistan Iran corridor, highlighting where
        deadly risks are most acute.

    <!-- Exploratory Visualizations -->
    <div class="card">
      <div class="section-title">Exploratory Visualizations: Demographics, Origins, Causes and Routes</div>
      <p>
        To understand the underlying patterns in migrant deaths, we first explore descriptive statistics and
        visualizations based on the full dataset. These include demographic breakdowns, top countries of origin,
        the most common causes of death, and the relative frequency and danger of different migration routes.
        These insights help lay the foundation for the spatial analyses that follow.
      </p>

      <!-- Demographics -->
      <div class="sub-title">Demographic Profile of the Deceased: Demographic Distribution</div>
      <p>
        The vast majority of recorded deaths involve men (66.3 percent), followed by women (20.9 percent) and
        children (12.9 percent). This distribution reflects broader global migration patterns, where adult males
        are more likely to undertake risky routes. However, the substantial proportion of women and children
        highlights growing vulnerabilities across migrant groups, particularly in family based or forced
        displacements.
      </p>

      <!-- Image 1: Piechart -->
      <div class="figure-block">
        <img src="./Piechart.jpg" alt="Demographic distribution of deaths and missing">
      </div>

      <!-- Origins -->
      <div class="sub-title">Geographic Origins of Migrants: Top 10 Countries of Origin</div>
      <p>
        The country of origin offers important context for understanding migratory push factors. A significant
        portion of the data is marked as “Unknown”, underscoring the frequent lack of identification during fatal
        incidents. Among identifiable cases, countries like Afghanistan (17 percent) and Mexico (8 percent) are
        most represented, followed by a variety of African and Central American nations. These patterns correspond
        to regions affected by conflict, instability, and poverty.
      </p>

      </div>

      <!-- Causes -->
      <div class="sub-title">Causes of Death: Top 6</div>
      <p>
        By far the most frequent cause of death is drowning (57.5 percent), highlighting the extreme risks of
        maritime crossings, especially in the Mediterranean and Atlantic. A considerable portion of cases are
        labeled as mixed or unknown causes (14.5 percent), revealing gaps in incident reporting. Other major
        contributors include hazardous transport accidents (8.9 percent), violence (6.8 percent), and harsh
        environmental conditions (6.8 percent) such as dehydration, desert exposure, and extreme temperatures,
        particularly on land routes through the Sahara.

      <!-- Routes: incidents -->
      <div class="sub-title">Migration Routes: Comparing Exposure and Fatality</div>
      <p>
        <strong>Routes by reported incidents.</strong> This bar chart shows the most frequently reported migration
        routes in terms of number of incidents. The US Mexico border leads with approximately 35 percent of all
        reported incidents, followed by the Afghanistan Iran corridor and Sahara Desert crossings. However, this
        chart only reflects event frequency, not severity.
      </p>

      <!-- Image 4: Routes by incidents -->
      <div class="figure-block">
        <img src="./Top_Mirgation_Routes_by_Incidents.jpg" alt="Migration routes by incidents">
      </div>

      <p style="margin-top:16px;">
        <strong>Routes by deaths and missing.</strong> When shifting the focus to the actual number of deaths and
        disappearances, a stark contrast becomes evident: the Mediterranean route emerges as the deadliest by far,
        accounting for over 50 percent of all recorded deaths globally. Other high risk corridors include the Sahara
        Desert (11 percent), US Mexico border (10 percent), Canary Islands route (7.7 percent), Eastern Route to or
        from EHOA (6.8 percent), and the Afghanistan Iran corridor (5 percent).
      </p>

      <p>
        This divergence between frequency and fatality underscores the importance of looking beyond event counts.
        While land crossings may be more common, maritime routes often involve capsized vessels and mass casualties
        in single incidents. For this reason, our subsequent analyses concentrate on six key migration corridors
        where the impact is most severe.
      </p>

      <!-- Selected routes -->
      <div class="section-title" style="margin-top:22px;">Selected Routes for Deeper Analysis</div>
      <div class="note big">
        Based on the visualizations above, our analysis focuses on six corridors that account for over 92 percent of global deaths:
        the Mediterranean (Central, Western, Eastern), Sahara Desert, US Mexico border, Canary Islands route,
        Eastern Route to or from EHOA, and the Afghanistan Iran corridor.
        These were selected due to their high burden of fatality, geographic diversity, and representativeness of broader global patterns.
