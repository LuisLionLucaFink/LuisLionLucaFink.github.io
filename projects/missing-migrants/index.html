      <p>
        This dashboard visualizes migrant deaths and disappearances across the globe. It highlights major migration
        corridors and uses spatial analysis to uncover meaningful geographic and temporal patterns. The visualizations
        aim to support humanitarian understanding through interactive maps and clustering techniques.

    <!-- Motivation -->
    <div class="card">
      <div class="section-title">Motivation</div>
      <p>
        Every year, thousands of migrants risk their lives crossing international borders. Many do not survive.
        While these tragedies are often reduced to numbers, this project uses data to identify where and when these
        deaths and disappearances happen, across multiple major migration routes.
      </p>
      <p>
        By uncovering spatial and temporal patterns in migrant fatalities across the top six most dangerous migration
        corridors, including the Mediterranean, the US Mexico border, the Sahara Desert and others, this analysis aims
        to support evidence based action. The goal is not just to visualize loss, but to reveal where preventive
        measures could save the most lives.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Data Source -->
    <div class="card">
      <div class="section-title">Data Source</div>
      <p>
        The data is provided by the International Organization for Migration through the Missing Migrants Project.
        It documents deaths and disappearances during migration worldwide. The dataset includes time, location,
        demographics, and cause of death. It spans from 2014 to the present and is continuously updated by NGOs,
        media, and official sources.

    <!-- Global Heatmap -->
    <div class="card">
      <div class="section-title">Global Heatmap of Incidents</div>
      <p>
        To provide an initial spatial overview, we created a global heatmap that shows where migrant deaths and
        disappearances have occurred since 2014. Each data point is weighted by the number of dead and missing
        persons to emphasize severity.
      </p>
      <p>
        This visualization helps identify high risk zones and geographic concentrations of migrant fatalities. It
        serves as a baseline for more detailed route specific analyses that follow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Clear global patterns emerge from this heatmap: high densities are visible in North Africa, the Central and
        Eastern Mediterranean, the US Mexico border region, and the Afghanistan Iran corridor, highlighting where
        deadly risks are most acute.

    <!-- Exploratory Visualizations -->
    <div class="card">
      <div class="section-title">Exploratory Visualizations: Demographics, Origins, Causes and Routes</div>
      <p>
        To understand the underlying patterns in migrant deaths, we first explore descriptive statistics and
        visualizations based on the full dataset. These include demographic breakdowns, top countries of origin,
        the most common causes of death, and the relative frequency and danger of different migration routes.
        These insights help lay the foundation for the spatial analyses that follow.
      </p>

      <!-- Demographics -->
      <div class="sub-title">Demographic Profile of the Deceased: Demographic Distribution</div>
      <p>
        The vast majority of recorded deaths involve men (66.3 percent), followed by women (20.9 percent) and
        children (12.9 percent). This distribution reflects broader global migration patterns, where adult males
        are more likely to undertake risky routes. However, the substantial proportion of women and children
        highlights growing vulnerabilities across migrant groups, particularly in family based or forced
        displacements.

      <!-- Origins -->
      <div class="sub-title">Geographic Origins of Migrants: Top 10 Countries of Origin</div>
      <p>
        The country of origin offers important context for understanding migratory push factors. A significant
        portion of the data is marked as “Unknown”, underscoring the frequent lack of identification during fatal
        incidents. Among identifiable cases, countries like Afghanistan (17 percent) and Mexico (8 percent) are
        most represented, followed by a variety of African and Central American nations. These patterns correspond
        to regions affected by conflict, instability, and poverty.

      <!-- Causes -->
      <div class="sub-title">Causes of Death: Top 6</div>
      <p>
        By far the most frequent cause of death is drowning (57.5 percent), highlighting the extreme risks of
        maritime crossings, especially in the Mediterranean and Atlantic. A considerable portion of cases are
        labeled as mixed or unknown causes (14.5 percent), revealing gaps in incident reporting. Other major
        contributors include hazardous transport accidents (8.9 percent), violence (6.8 percent), and harsh
        environmental conditions (6.8 percent) such as dehydration, desert exposure, and extreme temperatures,
        particularly on land routes through the Sahara.

      <!-- Routes: incidents -->
      <div class="sub-title">Migration Routes: Comparing Exposure and Fatality</div>
      <p>
        <strong>Routes by reported incidents.</strong> This bar chart shows the most frequently reported migration
        routes in terms of number of incidents. The US Mexico border leads with approximately 35 percent of all
        reported incidents, followed by the Afghanistan Iran corridor and Sahara Desert crossings. However, 
        this chart only reflects <strong>incident frequency</strong>, not the severity of each incident.
        It is important to note that a single recorded incident may involve <em>one individual</em>
        or <em>many people</em>. For example, an incident can represent a large-scale boat disaster
        resulting in hundreds of deaths, or a single migrant who dies during a desert crossing.
      </p>

      <p style="margin-top:16px;">
        <strong>Routes by deaths and missing.</strong> When shifting the focus to the actual number of deaths and
        disappearances, a stark contrast becomes evident: the Mediterranean route emerges as the deadliest by far,
        accounting for over 50 percent of all recorded deaths globally. Other high risk corridors include the Sahara
        Desert (11 percent), US Mexico border (10 percent), Canary Islands route (7.7 percent), Eastern Route to or
        from EHOA (6.8 percent), and the Afghanistan Iran corridor (5 percent).

      </div>

      <p>
        The observed differences between migration routes based on incident counts versus total deaths and missing 
        persons are largely explained by the nature of incidents on each route: At the US–Mexico border, 
        many incidents involve individual crossings, where typically one person is recorded as missing or deceased. 
        In contrast, Mediterranean incidents often involve entire boats capsizing, where a single incident can result 
        in dozens or even hundreds of deaths at once, due to overcrowded vessels attempting dangerous sea crossings.
      </p>

      <!-- Selected routes -->
      <div class="section-title" style="margin-top:22px;">Selected Routes for Deeper Analysis</div>
      <div class="note big">
        <strong>Analytical focus:</strong><br>
        While incident-based visualizations provide insight into the frequency of reported events,
        they do not capture the <em>severity</em> of migration routes.
        <br><br>
        For this reason, the subsequent analyses focus on migration corridors ranked by the
        number of <strong>deaths and missing persons</strong>, which provide a more meaningful measure
        of humanitarian impact.
        <br><br>
        In detail, it concentrates on six major corridors that together
        account for over <strong>92&nbsp;percent of global recorded deaths</strong>:
        the Mediterranean routes (Central, Western, Eastern), the Sahara Desert,
        the US–Mexico border, the Canary Islands route,
        the Eastern Route to or from EHOA, and the Afghanistan–Iran corridor.
        These corridors were selected due to their high fatality burden, geographic diversity,
        and representativeness of broader global migration patterns.
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Temporal and Spatial-Temporal Patterns -->
    <div class="card">
      <div class="section-title">Temporal and Spatial-Temporal Patterns</div>
    
      <p>
        In this step, we examine how migrant deaths and disappearances evolve over time.
        The analysis focuses on both monthly and yearly temporal patterns across the six
        selected migration corridors, providing insight into seasonal dynamics as well as
        longer-term trends. In addition, these temporal patterns form the basis for subsequent
        spatial-temporal analyses, where shifts in the geographic center of incidents are explored.
      </p>
    
      <div class="sub-title">Monthly Patterns</div>
      <p>
        When aggregating deaths and missing by month, clear seasonal variations become apparent,
        particularly along maritime routes. The Mediterranean corridor consistently records the
        highest number of fatalities throughout the year, with pronounced peaks during the spring
        and early summer months, especially in April, May, and June. These periods correspond to
        calmer sea conditions, during which a higher number of crossings are attempted, often in
        overcrowded and unsafe vessels.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        Other routes, such as the Sahara Desert, the Canary Islands, and the Eastern Route to or
        from EHOA, exhibit more moderate seasonal fluctuations. In contrast, the US–Mexico border
        shows a relatively even distribution of deaths and missing across the year. This reflects
        fundamental differences in migration mechanisms: while sea-based crossings are highly
        dependent on weather and seasonal conditions, land-based routes are influenced by a broader
        range of social, political, and enforcement-related factors and are less directly tied to
        climate seasonality.
      </p>
    
      <!-- Monthly plot -->
      <div class="figure-block">
        <img src="./DaM_by_Month.jpg" alt="Total deaths and missing by month across migration routes">
      </div>
    
      <div class="sub-title">Yearly Patterns</div>
      <p>
        Examining the data on a yearly basis reveals distinct longer-term trends across the
        selected migration corridors. Deaths along the Mediterranean routes peaked sharply between
        2015 and 2016, followed by a substantial decline until around 2020. In more recent years,
        particularly between 2022 and 2023, fatalities have increased again, indicating a renewed
        intensification of risk along this corridor.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        The Canary Islands route and the Afghanistan–Iran corridor display a different trajectory,
        with marked increases in deaths and disappearances after 2020. These trends suggest shifting
        migration pressures and route adaptations in response to geopolitical developments,
        border controls, and regional instability. In contrast, the Sahara Desert and the
        US–Mexico border routes remain comparatively stable over time, showing fluctuations but
        no dramatic peaks comparable to those observed in the Mediterranean.
